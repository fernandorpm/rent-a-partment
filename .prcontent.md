# About the Project
> Rent-a-partment is a renting website based on Zattix, an e-commerce designed by Mohammed Awad.
> The original project can be found ![here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX).
> Some aspects of the page were not previously designed and had to be designed by me - **and this is part of the Capstone**. For example, the mobile version of the Search page was designed by me.
